# robotics
various robotics algorithms including wavefront propagation, tangential vector field reactive behavior for use in player/stage

Herein are several algorithms related to robotic path planning, localization, navigation, and obstacle avoidance.
The programs are run with the Player/Stage robotics framework, and make use of sick lasers for wall detection.

require the default .cfg and .world files that come with player/stage
